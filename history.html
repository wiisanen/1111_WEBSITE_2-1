			   <h2>What Is An IDE?</h2>
			   <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
			   programmers for software development. IDE's typically contain a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger
			   that the developer accesses through a single graphical user interface. It can be a standalone application, or it may be included 
			   as part of one or more existing and compatible applications.Became possible when developing via a console or terminal. 
			   Early systems could not support one, since programs were prepared using flowcharts, entering programs with punched 
			   cards before submitting them to a compiler. Dartmouth BASIC was the first language to be created with an IDE</p>

			   <h2>What is Visual Studio?</h2>
			   <p>Visual Studio is one of the most famous Microsoft products and is specifically designed for development goals.
			   It's the most popular tool for all developers who use Microsoft development technologies and is widely used by 
			   developers around the world. It is built on an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and enables users to
			   build different types of applications using Microsoft programming languages. Visual Studio, which is abbreviated
			   as V.S. by community members, supports several platforms and programming languages "Out of the box,” that is
			   without requiring additional installations, plug-ins, expansion packs, or products.</p>
				<br />
			   <h2>The Beginning: Visual Studio 97</h2>
			   <p>1997 was the first year in which Microsoft tried to build a single environment for developing
			   in multiple languages. In that year, it introduced Visual Studio as an IDE for development, and it included the
			   following elements and languages: Visual Basic 5.0, Visual 5.0, Visual FoxPro 5.0 (for XBase programming),
			   Visual J++ 1.1 (for Java programming for Windows), Visual InterDev (for creating dynamic web pages With ASP),
			   MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network), Visual C++, Visual J++, Visual InterDev, and MSDN used the same environment
			   named Developer Studio, while Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro had their own environments.
			   Visual Studio 97 was a first attempt and a first version, but even then it was a great development. Back then,
			   every developer could enjoy working in this IDE. Current versions of Visual Studio are very different,
			   in terms of both the user interface and the features that are included. The internal version of Visual Studio 97 was 5.0.</p>

			   <h2 style="text-align: center;">Noteable Version Features</h2>
			   <br />
			   
			   <!--Visual studio 1998-->
			   <h5>Visual Studio 6.0 - </h5>	
			   <p>Version 6.0 (codenamed Aspen) was released in June 1998 and was the last version
			   to run on the Windows 9x platform. The v6 edition of Microsoft was the core environment
			   for the next four releases to provide programmers with an integrated look-alike platform.
			   This led Microsoft to transition the development on the platform independent .NET Framework.
			   Visual Studio 6.0 was the last version to include Visual J++, which Microsoft removed as
			   part of a settlement with Sun Microsystems that required Microsoft Internet Explorer
			   not to provide support for the Java virtual machine.</p>
			   <p>Visual Studio 6.0 came in two editions: Professional and Enterprise.
			   The Enterprise edition contained extra features not found in Professional edition, including:</p>
			   <ul>
				   <li>Application Performance Explorer</li>
				   <li>Automation Manager</li>
				   <li>Microsoft Visual Modeler</li>
				   <li>RemAuto Connection Manager</li>
				   <li>Visual Studio Analyzer</li>
			   </ul>
			   <br />
			   
			   <!--Visual studio 2002-->
			   <h5>Visual Studio .NET (2002) - </h5>	
			   <p>Microsoft released Visual Studio .NET (VS.NET) (codenamed Rainier) in February 2002.
			   The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the .NET Framework.
			   Programs developed using .NET are not compiled to machine language (like C++ is, for example)
			   but instead to a format called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) or Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
			   When a CIL application executes, it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine
			   language for the platform it is being executed on, thereby making code portable across several platforms.
			   This was the first version of Visual Studio to require an NT-based Windows platform, the installer enforces this requirement.</p>
			   <br />
			   
			   <!--Visual studio 2005-->
			   <h5>Visual Studio 8.0 (2005) - </h5>	
			   <p>Visual Studio 2005 was upgraded to support all the new features introduced in .NET Framework 2.0,
			   including generics and ASP.NET 2.0. The IntelliSense feature in Visual Studio was upgraded for generics
			   and new project types were added to support ASP.NET web services. Visual Studio 2005 also includes a
			   local web server, separate from IIS, which can host ASP.NET applications during development and testing.
			   It also supports all SQL Server 2005 databases.</p>
			   <p>Other new features of Visual Studio 2005 include the "Deployment Designer"
			   which allows application designs to be validated before deployments, an improved environment
			   for web publishing when combined with ASP.NET 2.0 and load testing to see application
			   performance under various sorts of user loads. Starting with the 2005 edition,
			   Visual Studio also added extensive 64-bit support. While the host development environment
			   itself is only available as a 32-bit application, Visual C++ 2005 supports compiling
			   for x86-64 (AMD64 and Intel 64) as well as IA-64 (Itanium). The Platform SDK included
			   64-bit compilers and 64-bit versions of the libraries.</p>
			   <br />
			   
			   <!--Visual studio 2008-->
			   <h5>Visual Studio 9.0 (2008) - </h5>	
			   <p>Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio Team System 2008 (codenamed Orcas) were released
			   to MSDN subscribers on November 19th 2007, alongside .NET Framework 3.5.
			   The source code for the Visual Studio 2008 IDE is available under a shared source
			   license to some of Microsoft's partners and ISV’s. Microsoft released Service Pack 1
			   for Visual Studio 2008 on August 11th 2008. The internal version number of Visual
			   Studio 2008 is version 9.0 while the file format version is 10.0. Visual Studio 2008
			   is the last version to support targeting Windows 2000 for C++ applications.
			   Visual Studio 2008 is focused on development of Windows Vista, 2007 Office system,
			   and Web applications. For visual design, a new Windows Presentation Foundation visual
			   designer and a new HTML/CSS editor influenced by Microsoft Expression Web are included
			   (J# is not included).</p>
			   <p>Visual Studio 2008 features include: </p>
			   <ul>
				   <li>An XAML-based designer (codenamed Cider)</li>
				   <li>Workflow designer</li>
				   <li>LINQ to SQL designer (for defining the type mappings and object encapsulation for SQL Server data)</li>
				   <li>XSLT debugger</li>
				   <li>JavaScript IntelliSense support</li>
				   <li>JavaScript Debugging support</li>
				   <li>A concurrent build system</li>
				   <li>A multithreaded build engine (MSBuild) to compile multiple source files in a project across multiple threads simultaneously</li>
				   <li>Support for compiling icon resources in PNG format, introduced in Windows Vista</li>
			   </ul>
			   <br />
			   
			   <!--Visual studio 2010-->
			   <h5>Visual Studio 10.0 (2010) - </h5>
			   <p>On April 12th 2010, Microsoft released Visual Studio 2010 (codenamed Dev10)
			   and .NET Framework 4. The Visual Studio 2010 IDE was redesigned which, according
			   to Microsoft, clears the UI organization and "reduces clutter and complexity."
			   The new IDE better supports multiple document windows and floating tool windows,
			   while offering better multi-monitor support. Visual Studio 2010 comes with .NET
			   Framework 4 and supports developing applications targeting Windows 7.
			   Visual Studio 2010 no longer supports development for Windows Mobile prior to Windows Phone 7.</p>
			   <ul>
				   <li>Tools for profiling and debugging parallel applications
				   (Tools for profiling parallel applications can be used for
				   visualization of thread wait-times and thread migrations across
				   processor cores. Intel and Microsoft have jointly pledged support
				   for a new Concurrency Runtime in Visual Studio 2010 and Intel has
				   launched parallelism support in Parallel Studio as an add-on for Visual Studio)</li>
				   <li>A new Help System replacing the MSDN Library viewer</li>
				   <li>Quick Search feature to incrementally search across all symbols in C++, C# and VB.NET projects</li>
			   </ul>
			   <h5>Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 </h5>
			   <p>Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 replaces Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite.
			   It includes new modeling tools such as: </p>
			   <ul>
				   <li>The Architecture Explorer, which graphically displays projects
				   and classes and the relationships between them</li>
				   <li> Supports UML activity diagram, component diagram,
				   (logical) class diagram, sequence diagram, and use case diagram</li>
				   <li>Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases
				   are impacted by modifications to the source code, without actually
				   running the test cases. This speeds up testing by avoiding running
				   unnecessary test cases.</li>
				   <li>A historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace.
				   Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack,
				   IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters,
				   events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a
				   breakpoint was not set where the error occurred.</li>
			   </ul>
			   <br />
			   
			   <h5>Visual Studio 11.0 (2012) - </h5>	
			   <p>Visual Studio 2012 was announced on August 1st 2012, and the official launch event was held
			   on September 12th 2012. Unlike prior versions, Visual Studio 2012 couldn’t record and play macros,
			   because the macro editor has been removed. "Visual Studio 2012 Update 1" was released in November 2012.
			   This update added support for Windows XP targets and also added other new tools and features
			   (e.g. improved diagnostics and testing support for Windows Store apps).The source code of Visual Studio 2012
			   consists of approximately 50 million lines of code.</p>
			   <p>Some of the new features include: </p>
			   <ul>
				   <li>Support for WinRT and C++/CX (Component Extensions) and C++ AMP (GPGPU programming) Semantic Colorization.</li>
				   <li>New Solution Explorer: The new Solution Explorer allows for visualization of class and file hierarchies
				   within a solution/project. It can search for calls to functions and uses of classes.</li>
				   <li>Automatic display of IntelliSense list: IntelliSense is automatically displayed when typing
				   code, as opposed to previous versions where it had to be explicitly invoked through use of
				   certain operators or shortcut keys (Ctrl-Space or Ctrl-J).</li>
			   </ul>
			   <br />
			   
			   <h5>Visual Studio 12.0 (2013) - </h5>
			   <p>Visual Studio 2013 officially launched on November 13th 2013 at a virtual launch event keynoted by S. Somasegar
			   and hosted on events.visualstudio.com. "Visual Studio 2013 Update 1" was released on January 20th 2014.
			   Update 1 was a targeted update that addressed some key areas of customer feedback. "Visual Studio 2013 Update 2”
			   was released on May 12th 2014, and Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 was released on August 4th 2014. With this update,
			   Visual Studio provides an option to disable the all-caps menus, which was introduced in Visual Studios 2012.
			   "Visual Studio 2013 Update 4" was released on November 12th 2014, and "Visual Studio 2013 Update 5" was released on July 20th 2015. </p>
			   <br />
			   
			   <h5>Visual Studio 15.0 - (2017) </h5>	
			   <p>Visual Studio 2017 which was initially referred to as Visual Studio "15,”
			   was released on March 7th 2017. The first Preview was released on March 30th 2016,
			   with four more previews released from May 10th 2016 - October 5th 2016.
			   On November 16, 2016, "Visual Studio 2017" was announced as the final name,
			   and Visual Studio 2017 RC was released. On March 7th 2017, Visual Studio 2017
			   was released for general availability. On April 5th 2017, Visual Studio 2017
			   15.1 was released and added support for targeting the .NET Framework 4.7.</p>
